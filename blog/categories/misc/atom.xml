    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since my last post. I have been doing things in between. Doing projects with node.js, trying to wrap my head around functional programming (haskell, to be particular) and stuff. This post is about one of those things which are not apparent outright and you just kinda realize how they have played some part in your work/life.</p>

<p>I like listening to music occasionally. Sometimes I <em>tried</em> to use it to drown out ambient noise while at work. Ok, maybe more frequently than sometimes. But mostly, it made things worse. The volume of noise increases, the noise itself increases and it was a total party. Not in a good way.</p>

<p>I, like countless other geeks, consume boatloads of articles and discussions each week. As such, I came across a thread at HN with guys discussing various genres of music they like to code to. And I was rather interested at how many of them were favoring classical music. The science was all there. Classical music had little to no voices, smooth, flowing notes and isn&rsquo;t aimed at assaulting your senses.</p>

<p>I thought I was a big fan of new age. Hip hop. Pop. Following are a few myths I busted myself. Note that this is my own perception and may not be in agreement with yours.</p>

<ul>
<li>Classical music is boring and slow: When I first listened to Mozart, I was blown away by knowledge that only 10 fingers were playing those notes that fast. I am not trying to belittle new-age, but I feel almost all classical artists had what One Direction will never have ;)</li>
<li>It makes you sleepy and that&rsquo;s not what you want at work: It actually helped me stay in the zone for longer. Any programmer would agree with me here. One <em>cannot</em> feel sleepy in the zone. Never. It&rsquo;s what I am doing that can bore me, not what I am listening to.</li>
</ul>


<p>I have gone classical. I enjoy Beethoven and Mozart. Vivaldi too, which is playing as I am writing this. And it has not slowed my rate of typing or making me to tear my mind away from voices and beats to focus. It&rsquo;s playing. I&rsquo;m writing. Bliss.</p>
