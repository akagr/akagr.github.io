    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I first heard of node.js, I was in graduation just getting into rails. But I seriously took notice when it displaced rails as the most popular repo on github. Speed whore as I am, I found event-driven non-blocking I/O particularly seducing.</p>

<p>I knew some elementary javascript and even at my work-ex of 7 months, never really used pure js. So I guessed, that just like ruby, I will definitely need to learn javascript a little. The world will be written in javascript in near future. Might as well start speaking it now.</p>

<p>That said, my javascript is still quite rusty. But at least I now understand how to utilize functions as closures and decided to return to node. Being a web-dev, obviously I can&rsquo;t be playing with vanilla quite long. After saying hello to a couple of worlds and writing my own servers with some routes thrown in for taste, meteor caught my eye.</p>

<p>About the only downside I can think of it is is that it does not have eyes for anything other than MongoDb. So I can&rsquo;t just start writing code for my projects.</p>

<p>A nodejs project should be coming my way in sometime. I am hopeful of that. I will be spending as much time as I can manage with node till then. Should be an interesting journey.</p>
