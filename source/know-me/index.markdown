Hey!

Thanks for reading this page. 

I am currently based in Lucknow, India working as a Ruby on Rails Dev in [Laitkor Software Services](http://laitkor.com). I have a B.Tech in Computer Science from Uttar Pradesh Technical University, Lucknow.

I enjoy writing ruby and am highly opinionated on a couple of things. First, if given my way, I'll put git in curriculum for first-graders. And second, solarized colors are rad! My editor is solarized, my terminal is solarized and my dog will be called Solo if I ever own one :)

Server side javascript has had me hooked up lately. I really dig speed. So, V8 along with hashed performance of NoSQL is kinda seductive. Still, it is something I am still exploring.

When I not in front of my machine, I can be found riding my bike, playing games and watching movies.

If you have suggestions/corrections regarding any of my posts, please take to the comments. Related content belongs together. Still, if you want to reach out to me personally, you can always message me on [twitter](http::/twitter.com/akshagrwl) or email me at [akagr@outlook.com](mailto:akagr@outlook.com).
