Hey!

My name is Akash Agrawal. I am currently based in Lucknow, India working as a Ruby on Rails Dev in [Laitkor Software Services](http://laitkor.com). I graduated from Uttar Pradesh Technical University with B.Tech in Computers in 2013.

I enjoy writing ruby and love reading elegant code. Vim and sublime text are my main and side weapons. Server side javascript has had me hooked up lately. I really dig speed. So, V8 along with hashed performance of NoSQL is kinda seductive. 

When I not in front of my machine, I can be found riding my bike, playing games or reading sci-fi.

If you have suggestions/corrections regarding any of my posts, please take to the comments. Related content belongs together. For anything else, you can always message me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/akshagrwl) or email me at [akagr@outlook.com](mailto:akagr@outlook.com).

Thanks for reading.
