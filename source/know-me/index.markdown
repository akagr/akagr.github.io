Hey!

Thanks for reading this page. Not many come this far. 

I am currently based in Lucknow, India where I work as a Ruby on Rails Dev in [Laitkor Software Services](http://laitkor.com). I have a B.Tech in Computer Science from Uttar Pradesh Technical University, Lucknow.

I love smell of good code in the morning. I love writing ruby and am highly opinionated about how everyone should be using git all the time. Heck, I even tried to force it on my friends to get their wedding invitation drafts checked into revision control :) 

I have become quite interested in server side javascript lately. I dig speed and fast running javascript along with hashed performance of NoSQL in kinda seductive. Still, it is something I am still exploring.

When I not in front of my machine, I can be found riding my bike, playing games and wattching movies.
