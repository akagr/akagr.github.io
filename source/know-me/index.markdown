Hey!

My name is Akash Agrawal(duh!). I am currently based in Lucknow, India working as a Ruby on Rails Dev in [Laitkor Software Services](http://laitkor.com). I graduated from Uttar Pradesh Technical University with B.Tech in Computers in 2013.

I enjoy writing ruby and love reading elegant code. Vim is my weapon of choice. Server side javascript has had me hooked up lately. I really dig speed. So, V8 along with hashed performance of NoSQL is kinda seductive. 

When I not in front of my machine, I can be found riding my bike, playing games or reading sci-fi.
