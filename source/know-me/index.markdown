Hey!

I am Akash. I live in Lucknow, India where I work as dev at [Laitkor Infosolution Pvt. Ltd.](http://laitkor.com)

This blog is basically my pensive. Reflections, backups, what have you. And in case you're wondering, the title of my blog is not random. I speak fluent javascript and ruby. Better than I speak English. But synthetic implants... if only.

Thanks for reading this abrupt, strange but accurate(surprisingly) about-me page.

You can reach out to me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/akshagrwl) or email me at [akagr@outlook.com](mailto:akagr@outlook.com).

PS: If you think that I may need to work more to become a cyborg, you are probably confusing me with a robot. I advocate Darth Vader, not Wall-e.
