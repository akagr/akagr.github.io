I love using sublime text. But there is something about vim that just keeps me pulling back. It's not my default editor of choice (yet) but I still enjoy writing stuff with it when I am not working. This blog is a fine example. Following is my vim config file. Some settings are there thanks to authors of some excellent blogs. Others, I have written myself out of my own needs. One thing's for sure, when it comes to customizability, vim is the grand-daddy of them all.

``` vim
set nocompatible

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
" vundle config
" git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
" add this to bashrc or bash_profile: export TERM="xterm-256color"
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
  filetype off

  set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/vundle/
  call vundle#rc()

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
" Vundles
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
  Bundle 'gmarik/vundle'

  Bundle 'altercation/vim-colors-solarized'
  Bundle 'Raimondi/delimitMate'

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
" General
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
  set nobackup nowritebackup noswapfile
  filetype plugin indent on

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
" Interface
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
  " Syntax Highlighting
    set background=dark
    colorscheme solarized
    syntax enable

  set wildmenu wildmode=longest:full,full
  set ruler
  set number

  " Indentation
    set expandtab tabstop=2 shiftwidth=2 
    set smartindent autoindent copyindent

  " Search
    set ignorecase smartcase
    set hlsearch incsearch showmatch

  set magic

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
" Key Bindings
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
  let mapleader = ","
  let g:mapleader = ","
  nmap <leader>w :w!<cr>
  nmap <leader>q :q<cr>
  map j gj
  map k gk
  map <space> /
  map <c-space> ?
  map <silent> <leader>, :noh<cr>
```
I know I really need some plug-ins. This file, like everybody else's, is a work in progress. Feel free to rip it off if you are starting out with vim. You can thank me by suggesting some great plug-ins or hacks which you dig in the comments below.
