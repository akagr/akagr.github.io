One thing which I had a little difficulty wrapping my head around is the flat namespace of a bucket. No relationships, foreign keys or convenient(read: familiar) sql queries. It's just key and values and that's about it. Seriously, I recommend everyone to approach NoSQL with a clean slate and don't try and relate concepts with what you know of relational databases.
